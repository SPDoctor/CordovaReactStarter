# CordovaReactStarter
Starter project for building a Cordova cross-platform mobile application using React and TypeScript

This starter project is using React and TypeScript and Webpack to bundle and minify files.

The source code for your application is in the /src directory. The contents of the /www directory are created by Webpack, and will eventually become the web application that is rendered in your mobile app. I would advise against putting any source files in the /www folder, or including it in source control.

# Getting started

1. Make sure you have NodeJS, etc. installed on your development machine.
1. Install any build tools you may need, e.g. Visual Studio 2017 (free community edition will do)
1. Clone the repo to your local machine (click on the green Clone button, copy the url and then git clone.
